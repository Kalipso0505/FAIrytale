# Projekt Documentation Rules

## Purpose

The PROJEKT.md is the single place for documenting **project-wide concepts and constraints**
that cannot be reliably inferred from the code alone.

It is **not** a replacement for reading the code.
It exists to capture implicit knowledge, architectural intent, and non-obvious decisions.

---

## What MUST be documented

Only document topics that are **conceptual, cross-cutting, or implicit**, especially:

- High-level architectural or design decisions
- The authorization / permission model (roles, policies, invariants)
- Important domain-specific rules or assumptions
- Project-wide conventions that must be followed
- Intentional deviations from framework or industry standards
- Critical technical constraints or known trade-offs

---

## What MUST NOT be documented

Do NOT document anything that can be understood by reading the code, including:

- Classes, methods, services, DTOs, models, or controllers
- Route definitions or API endpoints
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Framework or Laravel default behavior
- Configuration values that are self-explanatory
- Anything already defined in OpenAPI or other specs

If something can be learned by reading the code, it does not belong in the README.

---

## Level of detail

- Prefer **principles over implementation**
- Prefer **rules over examples**
- Prefer **why over how**
- Keep the PROJEKT.md short and incomplete by design

The PROJEKT.md should rarely change.
Only update it when a **new concept or invariant** is introduced.

---

## Quality gate

Before adding or changing PROJEKT.md content, ask:

> Would an experienced developer still need this information  
> after reading the code carefully?

If the answer is **no**, do not add it.

---

## Allowed structure (optional)

The PROJEKT.md may include sections such as:

- Architecture Overview
- Authorization Model
- Domain Rules & Invariants
- Conventions & Constraints
- Non-obvious Dependencies

The exact structure is intentionally not fixed.
